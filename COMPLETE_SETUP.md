## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Prepare Your 4 Badge Images (10 minutes)

Create or design 4 different badge images:

**Recommended sizes:** 500x500px or 1000x1000px

**File names:**
- `winner-badge.png` - Gold trophy 🏆
- `runnerup-badge.png` - Silver trophy 🥈
- `finalist-badge.png` - Bronze trophy 🥉
- `participant-badge.png` - Standard badge 🎖️

**Design tips:**
- Use gold/yellow for winner
- Use silver/gray for runner-up
- Use bronze/brown for finalist
- Use blue/standard for participant
- Keep consistent branding across all

### Step 2: Upload Images to Lighthouse (5 minutes)

```bash
# Go to https://files.lighthouse.storage/
# Upload each image ONE BY ONE
```

**After each upload, SAVE the CID:**

```
WINNER_IMAGE_CID=bafkrei...
RUNNERUP_IMAGE_CID=bafkrei...
FINALIST_IMAGE_CID=bafkrei...
PARTICIPANT_IMAGE_CID=bafkrei...
```

**Test URLs (should show your images):**
```
https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/WINNER_IMAGE_CID
https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/RUNNERUP_IMAGE_CID
https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/FINALIST_IMAGE_CID
https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/PARTICIPANT_IMAGE_CID
```
